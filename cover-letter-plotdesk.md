**Application for Full Stack Developer Position**
**Plotdesk GmbH**

Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in joining Plotdesk as you build the "SAP for Artificial Intelligence" for the German Mittelstand and enterprise market. With 15+ years of experience architecting and developing enterprise-grade SaaS platforms, combined with my German language proficiency (B2) and previous work experience in Germany, I believe I can contribute significantly to your mission of creating the workplace of the future.

**Why Plotdesk Resonates With Me**

Your approach of combining cutting-edge AI technology with deep enterprise integration, while maintaining strict GDPR compliance and data sovereignty, aligns perfectly with my professional experience and values. Having worked in Berlin for Plista GmbH and collaborated with European teams at madewithlove in Belgium, I deeply understand the importance of data protection standards and the unique requirements of the German and European market.

**Relevant Experience**

**Enterprise Platform Architecture**: I founded and built a complete Bank as a Service (BaaS) platform from scratch using PHP/Laravel and Livewire (2018-2024). This involved:
- Architecting multi-tenant infrastructure supporting multiple financial institutions
- Implementing complex authorization policies and compliance modules
- Building REST APIs for mobile apps and third-party integrations
- Designing idempotent sync routines for reliable data synchronization
- Creating real-time dashboards and administrative tools

**SaaS & Enterprise Integration**: Most recently (2024), I've been building:
- Multi-tenant SaaS architecture with tiered licensing systems
- Investment fund platforms integrating multiple external APIs (Stark Bank)
- ETL pipeline migrations to AWS
- Infrastructure monitoring and abstraction layers

**Technical Expertise Aligned With Your Stack**:
- Backend: PHP/Laravel specialist with deep expertise in scalable architectures
- Frontend: Vue.js (Composition API, Inertia.js), Livewire, React
- Infrastructure: AWS (S3, SES, EC2, SQS, SNS), Docker
- Databases: MySQL, MongoDB, Redis
- Strong focus on clean architecture, security, and compliance

**German Market Understanding**

My B2 German proficiency and year of professional experience in Berlin give me valuable context for working with German clients and understanding their specific requirements around data protection, compliance, and business processes. I can communicate effectively with stakeholders and understand the nuances of the Mittelstand culture.

**What I Bring to Plotdesk**

- **Platform Thinking**: Experience building complete platforms from scratch, not just features
- **Enterprise Integration**: Deep expertise in connecting systems, APIs, and business processes
- **Multi-Tenancy Expertise**: Proven track record in architecting secure, scalable multi-tenant systems
- **Compliance Mindset**: Experience with regulated industries (banking, finance) where data protection and compliance are paramount
- **Full Stack Capability**: Ability to work across the entire stack, from infrastructure to user interfaces
- **Remote Collaboration**: Extensive experience working with distributed international teams

**Alignment With Your Mission**

I am particularly excited about Plotdesk's commitment to:
- **Data Sovereignty**: Your GDPR-compliant, Germany-hosted approach with European AI models
- **No Vendor Lock-in**: Building flexible, modular solutions that give customers control
- **Real Business Value**: Focus on practical solutions developed from the user perspective
- **Strengthening German Business**: Contributing to the competitiveness of the German economy

I would love to discuss how my experience in building enterprise platforms, my technical expertise in modern web technologies, and my understanding of the German market can contribute to Plotdesk's growth and success.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to speak with you.

Best regards,

Pedro Oliveira
